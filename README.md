  Chativily:

Tired of messy search results and unreliable summaries?
This system thinks like a researcher and writes like a professional. 

A system where smart research agent that searches the internet, organizes the information professionally, checks the quality, and gives you a final polished answer — automatically.

How it works:
- It uses Tavily to gather search results from the internet based on your query.
- It re-ranks the search results using a powerful CrossEncoder model to bring the most relevant information to the top.
- It formats the top results into a clean, formal, and professional summary using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- It performs a quality check using a Critic Agent to ensure the final response is clear, factually correct, and matches your query.
- If the Critic says “FAIL,” it automatically re-runs the search process to improve the answer until it's good.
